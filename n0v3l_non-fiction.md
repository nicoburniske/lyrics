# N0V3L - NON-FICTION

1. UNTOUCHABLE 

```

```

2. ## GROUP DISEASE

```
Obsessed with patterns, amazed with madness
A lust for meaning, a search for balance
Inductive logic, who’s the prophet
Arrangin’ order, chaos the author

A flood of answers, eternal questions
Who’s wrong or right, a new will listen
The loudest horses, preach destruction
Speak of choices, offer consumption

A group disease, to ease the ’spense, of make believe,
No cross to bear, repress the need, a pree to prayer
We shed our mirrors, no faith to spend

A group disease, to ease the ’spense, of make believe,
No cross to bear, repress the need, a pree to prayer
We shed our mirrors, no faith to spend

3. ## EN MASSE

4. ## FALLING IN LINE

```
Sterile package, wrapped up in plastic
I’m pissed and distracted, and passion no more
Fractured, passive, cradle the past year
Loyal things left in crate by the door

Backhall standards, feel nothing matters
Extras who actors, factors ignored 
Onwards who has us, daily disasters
Mass attachment, ideals conformed

Is he falling in line, stuck waiting behind
Pacifying the mind, with another white lie
Slowly losing his side, I only dream at night
No numbing the mind, Is he falling in line
Is he falling in line, nothing comes out right
Slowly losing sight
Is he falling in line, is he falling in line? 

Auto-matic, repel like a magnet
Pedantic in practice from magic performed
Values elastic is moral gymnastics
Make social dynamics a hollow rapport

Guarantee, certify, oversee, verify, overwhelm
Diss and preoccupy, afraid and free amplify, count me out

Is he falling in line, stuck waiting behind
Pacifying the mind, with another white lie
Slowly losing tide, I only dream at night
No numbing the mind, Is he falling in line
Is he falling in line, slowly losing sight
Barely dream at night
No numbing the mind, is he falling in line?

Is he falling in line, stuck waiting behind
Pacifying the mind, with another white lie
Slowly losing tide, I only dream at night
No numbing the mind, Is he falling in line
Is he falling in line, slowly losing sight
Barely dream at night
No numbing the mind, is he falling in line?

5. ## APATH

```
Living in lots fear, living in a bubble
Living in our heads, as structures turn to rubble
Fear in our heart, terror in the street
Agendas in the dark, force us to compete
Hiding from the truth, locking out the horror
Tuning in, tuning out, message out of order
Dying fast for money, chalk it up as freedom
Dish it out for nothing, conjure up a reason
Bury yourself in layers of apathy
Visit yourself with objecting silently
The big befriend the righteous simulation
Breed extremes of thought in isolation

Would you die for freedom? Can you repeat the choices? 
Still searching for a reason, in a crowd of preaching voices
What’s the cost of living? Can you repeat the question? 
Still feel like something’s missing, beneath one way reflection

Would you die for freedom? Can you repeat the choices? 
Still searching for a reason, in a crowd of preaching voices
What’s the cost of living? Can you repeat the question? 
Still feel like something’s missing, beneath one way reflection

Construct, tear it down
Contract, rip it up
Guarded, who’s around?
Hope think, not enough
Rushing, slow it down
Closed off, open up
Avoiding, look around
Look back, seen enough

11. ## NOTICE OF FORECLOSURE

```
Farewell to past days, to handwritten letters
New days upon us, nostalgia like whispers
Grip on the present like sand between fingers
Archaic anthems obscuring the picture
Analog mediums, forgotten scripture
Leather bound pages disclose what we live for
Forced adaptation, notice of foreclosure
Dragging us forward, an indifferent future
