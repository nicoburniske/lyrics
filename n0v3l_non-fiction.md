1. ## UNTOUCHABLE 

``` 
Kneel at the alter, expect wine from water
Why can't you snap out, nothing you care 'bout
The pills are a cop out, that you can't live without

You're good to begin now you, you close your eyes and now the tension is tactile
And lose control at times you, you're fear's still rolling, you might see you as we 
A mess is rolling it through, your self is trolling, consume over and over

Preaching of purpose, pattern, direction
Judgement of self, hunting for good intention
Destruction of progress, like self-immolation 
The magicness mistrust, full of reservations
Up to the dizzin, fill with corrosion, these pushers, go see if they're just there for emotion
Anxious and fearful, _ reversal
A _ _ , and without rehearsal 

Course it begs the question
Connecting lines with which you live for to die for
I'm blessed with _ it through, your self is trolling, consume over and over
```

2. ## GROUP DISEASE

```
Obsessed with patterns, amazed with madness
A lust for meaning, a search for balance
Inductive logic, who’s the prophet
Arrangin’ order, chaos the author

A flood of answers, eternal questions
Who’s wrong or right, a new will listen
The loudest horses, preach destruction
Speak of choices, offer consumption

A group disease, to ease the ’spense, of make believe,
No cross to bear, repress the need, a pree to prayer
We shed our mirrors, no faith to spend

A group disease, to ease the ’spense, of make believe,
No cross to bear, repress the need, a pree to prayer
We shed our mirrors, no faith to spend
```

3. ## EN MASSE

```
Climate of fear, is self-distrust in my neighbors 
Elected officials keep on losing the papers
Straining the seams of a political garment 
Colors beware, can turn all bans to a target

Free? Freedom is not free
Right and left don't see eye to eye
A forced truth that look right
Few reasons to agree, less even to be empathetic, a tolerant skeptic

Freeing/? on mass-manipulation is rising
With internet arms, politics on the rising
Turn off the left, right, left sniffed on the pavement
Middle state homes, start making these in the basement

Free? Freedom is not free
Right and left don't see eye to eye
A forced truth that look right
Few reasons to agree, less even to be empathetic, a tolerant skeptic
```
4. ## FALLING IN LINE

```
Sterile package, wrapped up in plastic
I’m pissed and distracted, and passion no more
Fractured, passive, cradle the past year
Loyal things left in crate by the door

Backhall standards, feel nothing matters
Extras who actors, factors ignored 
Onwards who has us, daily disasters
Mass attachment, ideals conformed

Is he falling in line, stuck waiting behind
Pacifying the mind, with another white lie
Slowly losing his side, I only dream at night
No numbing the mind, Is he falling in line
Is he falling in line, nothing comes out right
Slowly losing sight
Is he falling in line, is he falling in line? 

Auto-matic, repel like a magnet
Pedantic in practice from magic performed
Values elastic is moral gymnastics
Make social dynamics a hollow rapport

Guarantee, certify, oversee, verify, overwhelm
Diss and preoccupy, afraid and free amplify, count me out

Is he falling in line, stuck waiting behind
Pacifying the mind, with another white lie
Slowly losing tide, I only dream at night
No numbing the mind, Is he falling in line
Is he falling in line, slowly losing sight
Barely dream at night
No numbing the mind, is he falling in line?

Is he falling in line, stuck waiting behind
Pacifying the mind, with another white lie
Slowly losing tide, I only dream at night
No numbing the mind, Is he falling in line
Is he falling in line, slowly losing sight
Barely dream at night
No numbing the mind, is he falling in line?
```

5. ## APATH

```
Living in our heads, as structures turn to rubble
Fear in our heart, terror in the street
Agendas in the dark, force us to compete
Hiding from the truth, blocking out the horror
Tuning in, tuning out, message “Out of Order”
Dying fast for money, chalk it up as freedom
Dish it out for nothing, conjure up a reason
Bury yourself in layers of apathy
Busy yourself with objecting silently
Repeat refrain of righteous indignation
Breed extremes of thought in isolation

Would you die for freedom? Can you repeat the choices?
Still searching for a reason, in a crowd of preaching voices
What’s the cost of living? Can you repeat the question?
Still feel like something’s missing, beneath one way reflection

Would you die for freedom? Can you repeat the choices?
Still searching for a reason, in a crowd of preaching voices
What’s the cost of living? Can you repeat the question?
Still feel like something’s missing, beneath one way reflection

Construct, tear it down
Contract, rip it up
Guarded, who’s around?
Hope think, not enough
Rushing, slow it down
Closed off, open up
Avoiding, look around
Look back, seen enough

7. ## STRANGER

```
Enter my sea
Blocked by the danger, does sheepishly weep
Repeat this entire phrase
Singing to me, like you only know my name
Lost in purpose, barely scratching the surface

Feeling of watching the world through glass
Friendships like tokens, moments don't last
Consumed by the past, obsessed with the future
Nurture a stranger, stranger a friend

Friendships like tokens, moments don't last
Consumed by the past, obsessed with the future

```

8. ## VIOLENT & PARANOID

```
Violent and paranoid
Pacifist but overjoyed
Violent and glorified
Silent voices terrified

New faced to modernize
Force the rest to equalize
Burn too quick, intensified
Burn your pill of cyanide

Lose slip and undignify
Wake my hope is justified
Horrified, nation-wide 
Add intention amplify 

Violent and paranoid
????
Violent and paranoid
Violent and paranoid
```

9. ## PUSHERS

```
A travesty, normalized
No amnesty, desensitized
Indecent lovers, ? 
Under the cover of the medical system
Plant seeds of a good taste of feeling
Look no further than the bloodwork on the ceiling

???

In one ear and out the other
Skip the contents of the cover
Higher up, a fabrication, agents of alien nation

11. ## NOTICE OF FORECLOSURE

```
Farewell to past days, to handwritten letters
New days upon us, nostalgia like whispers
Grip on the present like sand between fingers
Archaic anthems obscuring the picture
Analog mediums, forgotten scripture
Leather bound pages disclose what we live for
Forced adaptation, notice of foreclosure
Dragging us forward, an indifferent future
